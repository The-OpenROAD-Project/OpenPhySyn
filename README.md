# OpenPhySyn

OpenPhySyn is a plugin-based physical synthesis optimization kit developed as part of the [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/) flow.

## Building

Build by creating a build directory (i.e. `build/`), run `cmake ..` in that directory, and then use `make` to build the desired target.

Example:

```bash
> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/apps/OpenPhySyn -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Coverage | Release]
> make
> make install
> ./Psn
> make test # Makes and runs the tests.
> make coverage # Generate a coverage report.
> make doc # Generate html documentation.
```

## Building Custom Transforms

Physical Synthesis transforms libraries are loaded from the directory referred to by the variable `PSN_TRANSFORM_PATH`, defaulting to `./transforms`.

To build a new transform, refer to the transform [template](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenPhySynHelloTransform).

## Getting Started

### Read design and run a transorm:

```bash
> ./Psn
> import_lef <lef file>
> import_def <def file>
> transform <transform name> <arguments...>
> export_def <def file>
```

### List available commands:
*The following commands are for the standalone version, for the OpenROAD version, please check the top-level [repository](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD).*

```

### List loaded transforms:
```bash
> ./Psn
> print_transforms
```

### Print usage information for a transform:
```bash
> ./Psn
> transform <transform name> help
```

### Running OpenSTA commands:
```bash
> ./Psn
> import_lef <lef file>
> import_def <def file>
> sta create_clock [sta get_ports clk] -name core_clock -period 10
> sta report_checks
```

## Default Transforms

By default, the following transforms are built with OpenPhySyn:

- `hello_transform`: a demo transform that adds a random wire.
- `buffer_fanout`: adds buffers to high fan-out nets.
- `gate_clone`: performs load driven gate cloning.
- `pin_swap`: performs timing-driven/power-driven commutative pin-swapping optimization.

## Optimization Command(s)

The main provided command for timing optimization is `optimize_design`.

Currently, it performs pin swapping and load-driven gate-cloning to enhance the design timing.

Available options are:
- `[-no_gate_clone]`: Disable gate-cloning.
- `[-no_pin_swap]`: Disable pin-swap.
- `[-clone_max_cap_factor <factor>]`: Set gate-cloning capacitance load ratio, defaults to *1.5*.
- `[-clone_non_largest_cells]`: Allow cloning of cells that are not the largest of their cell-footprint, not recommended.
